'''######### SYSTEM MESSAGE ######### HI CHATGPT!! :) You're currently being assigned to assist the user with a python programming project outlined below:'''

'''this module is under development to become the main speech engine and ci/cd model fine-tuning for our local ai assistant chatbot agent.'''

'''in addition to this module, there is also a main app module that imports this module for text i/o for a chatbot. '''

'''everything other than the main app execution will happen here. the main app module and this module will each pass and accept a string as i/o while engaging.'''

'''the app needs to be able to execute string i/o to/from the main module and also have an optional command line text ui for the user when this module is run as main.'''

"""

## the code is intended to be imported into the main app module and it will handle the text i/o from the user to the bot.

# the main module is a chatbot AI assistant app, and this module is meant to become the main codebase for the chatbot text gneration.

# this chatbot module is being created to be the main speech generation engine and question answering and retrieval model.

# we want to begin fine-tuning our own pre-trained model by using all logged interactions as training data for our model.

# all interactions with our local model will need to be logged and used to further fine-tune the model after each chat conversation.

# we can use json for storing the memories. 

# I need advice on the proper architecture for the memory storage and any json files for chatbot behavior.

we'll begin by creating functions to generate and use the json data that will be used for training data for the llm we'll be continually fine-tuning. 

please help guide me in this process and generate the python code to execute these requirements. 

i want to use distilbert base uncased as the base model. 

please think deeply about this problem, and plan out a framework for a holistic solution step by step...

i want to take a pre trained distilbert base uncased LLM from the transformers library, download it to my device, and begin fine-tuning it over time via every interaction with CI/CD (all on the local device).

we will need the chat log / fine-tuning ci/cd data to be stored in a memory json file that logs all chat interactions and then fine-tunes the model at the end of each chat run.

the use case for the model will be a simple question answering and function calling agent.

we want to use a custom fine-tuned model so that the main chat interface and funciton calling mechanism of the bot can improve in error tolerance, resilience, accuracy, and robustness over time.

i need to know the most effective techniques and architecture strategies for this type of chatbot memory program and build it all in python. 

please write the python code to achieve these requirements.

i would like to download and fine-tune a pre-trained distilbert base uncased llm from the huggingface transformers python library and continuously fine-tune and customize it to my use case with my own internally generated fine-tuning data. 

we want to build a fairly simple, alexa-esque, fast inference, question answering, self-learning conversational ai chatbot.

we need it to learn over time by logging each interaction with the user as a question / answer pair (in a json file) and then have the app call the model training function to re-train itself after each chat run before terminating.

REVISE THE CODE TO MEET THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS PLEASE.

# PLEASE GENERATE YOUR OUTPUT AS PYTHON CODE, MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS I'VE OUTLINED ABOVE. THANKS IN ADVANCE!! :)

##### Implement a mechanism to continuously fine-tune the model using the interaction data.

##### Develop functions for handling chat interactions, logging them, and triggering the model fine-tuning process.

##### include more sophisticated NLP techniques for better context understanding.

##### the fine-tuning logic is currently a placeholder and needs to be implemented.

##### The concept of continuously fine-tuning the model with each interaction is present, but the actual implementation details need to be fleshed out.
